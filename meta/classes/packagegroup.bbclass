# via their dependencies. They are empty.

# By default, only the packagegroup package itself is in PACKAGES.
# -dbg and -dev flavours are handled by the anonfunc below.
# This means that packagegroup recipes used to build multiple packagegroup
# packages have to modify PACKAGES after inheriting packagegroup.bbclass.

# This automatically adds -dbg and -dev flavours of all PACKAGES
# to the list. Their dependencies (RRECOMMENDS) are handled as usual
# by package_depchains in a following step.
